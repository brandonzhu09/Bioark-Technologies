<strong>Gene knock-in tagging</strong> is a technique used to insert\r\n            specific tags (such as fluorescent proteins, epitope tags, or\r\n            functional domains) into precise locations in the genome, typically\r\n            at the <strong>3' or 5' ends</strong> of target genes. This allows\r\n            for real-time tracking of gene expression, localization of proteins,\r\n            or functional studies of gene products without disrupting the gene's\r\n            natural regulatory mechanisms. The\r\n            <strong>CRISPR-Cas9 system</strong> is the cornerstone of gene\r\n            knock-in tagging. It employs a <strong>guide RNA (gRNA)</strong> to\r\n            direct the <strong>Cas9 endonuclease</strong> to a specific genomic\r\n            site, where it creates a double-strand break (DSB). The DSB is then\r\n            repaired by either\r\n            <strong>non-homologous end joining (NHEJ)</strong> or\r\n            <strong>homology-directed repair (HDR)</strong>.
