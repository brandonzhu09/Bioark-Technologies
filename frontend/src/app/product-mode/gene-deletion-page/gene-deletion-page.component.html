        <h1>Technical Background</h1>
        <p>
            <strong>CRISPR Genome Knockout Deletion</strong> is a powerful and
            versatile gene-editing technique that allows for the targeted
            removal or deletion of specific genomic sequences. This approach
            uses the CRISPR-Cas9 system, which is derived from the bacterial
            adaptive immune system and has been adapted for genome editing in a
            variety of organisms.
        </p>

        <h1>Key Components</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <strong>Cas9 Protein</strong>: A nuclease that introduces
                double-strand breaks (DSBs) at specified genomic locations based
                on the guidance of a complementary RNA sequence.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Guide RNA (gRNA)</strong>: A synthetic RNA molecule
                designed to bind to a specific target sequence in the genome,
                directing the Cas9 protein to the intended site.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>DNA Repair Mechanisms</strong>: Following the DSB
                created by Cas9, the cell's natural repair mechanisms take over.
                The primary repair pathways involved are:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Non-Homologous End Joining (NHEJ)</strong>: This
                        is the predominant pathway used for gene knockout. NHEJ
                        can lead to insertions or deletions (indels) at the
                        break site, causing frameshifts or premature stop
                        codons, ultimately resulting in gene knockout.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Homology-Directed Repair (HDR)</strong>:
                        Although not typically employed for knockout deletions,
                        HDR can be utilized for precise gene editing if a donor
                        template is provided.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h1>Feature of Our Products</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>
                We designed a specialized structure for the simultaneous
                delivery of two gRNAs, enabling the efficient removal of target
                genomic fragments larger than 10 kb.
            </li>
            <li>
                Unlike market alternatives that require electroporation, which
                demand specialized equipment and techniques, our plasmid kits
                are user-friendly and suitable for most labs, making them ideal
                for adherent cancer cell lines. For hard-to-transfect cells, we
                also offer a hybrid solution that combines the large gene
                capacity of lentivirus with the reduced integration effects of
                AAV virus, providing a convenient, research-focused kit.
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h1>Experimental Process</h1>
