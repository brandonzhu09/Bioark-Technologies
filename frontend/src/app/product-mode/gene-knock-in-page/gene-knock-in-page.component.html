        <h1>Technical Background</h1>
        <p>
            <strong>Gene knock-in tagging</strong> is a technique used to insert
            specific tags (such as fluorescent proteins, epitope tags, or
            functional domains) into precise locations in the genome, typically
            at the <strong>3' or 5' ends</strong> of target genes. This allows
            for real-time tracking of gene expression, localization of proteins,
            or functional studies of gene products without disrupting the gene's
            natural regulatory mechanisms. The
            <strong>CRISPR-Cas9 system</strong> is the cornerstone of gene
            knock-in tagging. It employs a <strong>guide RNA (gRNA)</strong> to
            direct the <strong>Cas9 endonuclease</strong> to a specific genomic
            site, where it creates a double-strand break (DSB). The DSB is then
            repaired by either
            <strong>non-homologous end joining (NHEJ)</strong> or
            <strong>homology-directed repair (HDR)</strong>. For knock-in
            tagging, HDR is typically used, where a
            <strong>donor template</strong>
            containing the tag and flanked by homology arms facilitates the
            precise insertion of the desired tag at the target locus.

        <h1>Key Components</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <strong>Cas9 Protein</strong>: Creates a DSB at the target site.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Guide RNA (gRNA)</strong>: Directs Cas9 to the desired
                genomic locus.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Donor Template</strong>: Contains the tag (e.g., GFP, HA
                tag) along with homology arms to facilitate HDR-mediated
                knock-in.
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h1>Feature of Our Products</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Our CRISPR and donor vectors are designed to be more
                streamlined, facilitating efficient target gene integration
                compared to commercially available products.
            </li>
            <li>
                Unlike market alternatives that require electroporation, which
                demand specialized equipment and techniques, our plasmid kits
                are user-friendly and suitable for most labs, making them ideal
                for adherent cancer cell lines. For hard-to-transfect cells, we
                also offer a hybrid solution that combines the large gene
                capacity of lentivirus with the reduced integration effects of
                AAV virus, providing a convenient, research-focused kit.
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h1>Experimental Process</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <strong>Design of gRNA and donor template vector</strong>:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The gRNA is designed to target a specific site, usually
                        near the <strong>3' or 5' end</strong> of the gene of
                        interest to insert the tag without affecting the gene's
                        function. The gRNA must be optimized to ensure high
                        specificity and minimal off-target effects.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The <strong>donor template</strong> can be a plasmid or
                        single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) and contains the tag flanked
                        by homology arms (~500-1000 bp) that are homologous to
                        the sequences surrounding the Cas9-induced DSB.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The tag can be
                        <strong>fluorescent markers</strong> (e.g., GFP,
                        mCherry), <strong>epitope tags</strong> (e.g., FLAG,
                        HA), or <strong>functional domains</strong>
                        (e.g., kinase domains, degradation signals).
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Cell Transfection, Screening and validation</strong>:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The <strong>Cas9/gRNA</strong> complex and the donor
                        template are delivered into the cells via
                        <strong>transfection</strong>
                        (e.g., lipofection, electroporation, or viral delivery).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        In <strong>hard-to-transfect cells</strong>, alternative
                        delivery methods such as
                        <strong>viral vectors</strong> (AAV or lentivirus) or
                        RNP (ribonucleoprotein) complexes can be used to
                        increase efficiency.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Screening and Validation</strong>:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>PCR-based screening</strong> is performed to
                        confirm the successful integration of the tag into the
                        target gene. Primers are designed to bind outside the
                        homology arms and amplify across the knock-in site.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Sequencing</strong> is often performed to ensure
                        correct and precise insertion without mutations.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If fluorescent tags are used,
                        <strong>fluorescence microscopy</strong> or
                        <strong>flow cytometry</strong> can be employed for
                        preliminary screening.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        After confirmation of the knock-in,
                        <strong>Western blotting</strong>,
                        <strong>immunofluorescence</strong>, or
                        <strong>co-immunoprecipitation</strong> (Co-IP) may be
                        used to validate the presence and functionality of the
                        inserted tag.
                    </li>
