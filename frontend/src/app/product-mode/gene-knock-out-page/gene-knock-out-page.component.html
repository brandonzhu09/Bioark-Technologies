        <h1>Technical Background</h1>
        <p>
            <strong>CRISPR knockout (KO)</strong> is a revolutionary
            gene-editing technique that allows researchers to disrupt or "knock
            out" specific genes within an organism's genome. The CRISPR-Cas9
            system is the most widely used tool for this purpose, harnessing a
            natural bacterial defense mechanism against viral infections.
        </p>

        <h1>Key Components</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <strong>Cas9 Protein</strong>: An endonuclease that introduces
                double-strand breaks (DSBs) in the DNA at specific genomic
                locations.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Guide RNA (gRNA)</strong>: A short RNA sequence that
                directs the Cas9 protein to the target gene by complementary
                base pairing.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Repair Pathways</strong>: Once the DSB is created, the
                cell's repair machinery activates. The primary pathways for
                repair are:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Non-Homologous End Joining (NHEJ)</strong>: This
                        repair mechanism often results in insertions or
                        deletions (indels) at the break site, leading to
                        frameshift mutations that can disrupt gene function.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Homology-Directed Repair (HDR)</strong>: Less
                        common for knockout purposes, HDR can be utilized when a
                        donor template is provided, but is typically used for
                        precise edits rather than knockouts.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            By utilizing the NHEJ repair pathway, researchers can effectively
            create gene knockouts, leading to a loss of gene function.

                    <li>
                        The gRNA is designed to target a specific gene of
                        interest, typically located in a conserved region of the
                        gene to maximize the likelihood of knockout.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Various online tools can be used to design gRNA
