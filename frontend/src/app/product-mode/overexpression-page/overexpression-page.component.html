        <h1>Technical Background</h1>
        <p>
            Using <strong>CRISPR-Cas9</strong> for
            <strong>targeted knock-in</strong> at safe harbor sites involves:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Cas9</strong>: An endonuclease that creates a
                double-strand break (DSB) at the target site.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Guide RNA (gRNA)</strong>: Directs Cas9 to the specific
                safe harbor locus.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Donor DNA template</strong>: A construct containing the
                desired transgene flanked by <strong>homology arms</strong> that
                are complementary to the sequences adjacent to the DSB, which
                facilitates targeted insertion via
                <strong>homology-directed repair (HDR)</strong>.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <strong>Safe harbor sites</strong> are specific regions in the
            genome where foreign DNA can be inserted without disrupting vital
            endogenous gene functions or causing harmful effects to the cell.
            These sites are often utilized for
            <strong>stable gene insertion</strong> in genome engineering because
            they support long-term and predictable expression of transgenes.
        </p>
        <p>Several common <strong>safe harbor loci</strong> include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>AAVS1 (PPP1R12C locus)</strong> on chromosome 19</li>
            <li><strong>ROSA26 locus</strong> in mice</li>
            <li><strong>H11 locus</strong> in human and murine genomes</li>
        </ul>

        <h1>Features of Our Products</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Our CRISPR and donor vectors are designed to be more
                streamlined, facilitating efficient target gene integration
                compared to commercially available products.
            </li>
            <li>
                Many products rely on non-targeting lentivirus for gene
                incorporation, leading to random integration, which poses safety
                risks and unforeseen complications, particularly in gene therapy
                and clinical research. Our vector and virus kits, however,
                deliver targeted integration at specific safe harbor sites,
                significantly mitigating these risks.
            </li>
            <li>
                Unlike market alternatives that require electroporation, which
                demands specialized equipment and techniques, our plasmid kits
                are user-friendly and suitable for most labs, making them ideal
                for adherent cancer cell lines. For hard-to-transfect cells, we
                also offer a hybrid solution that combines the large gene
                capacity of lentivirus with the reduced integration effects of
                AAV virus, providing a convenient, research-focused kit.
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Regular Plasmid</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>gRNA Selection</strong>: The guide RNA is designed to
                specifically target the chosen safe harbor site. The sequence
                must be carefully chosen to maximize on-target specificity and
                minimize off-target activity.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Cas9 Delivery</strong>: The CRISPR-Cas9 system can be
                delivered into cells using various methods such as plasmids,
                mRNA, or RNP (ribonucleoprotein complexes). Delivery methods
                depend on the cell type and the specific requirements of the
                experiment.
            </li>
            <li>
                The donor DNA contains the
                <strong>gene of interest (GOI)</strong> along with
                <strong>homology arms</strong> (typically 500-1000 bp) that
                match the sequence flanking the target safe harbor site.
            </li>
            <li>
                Depending on the application, the donor template may include
                selection markers (e.g., antibiotic resistance genes or
                fluorescent reporters) to aid in the identification of
                successfully modified cells.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Stable Cell Line Construction</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Cell Type</strong>: Common cell types used include
                <strong>HEK293</strong>, <strong>iPSCs</strong>, and other
                therapeutic or industrially relevant cell lines.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Transfection</strong>: Cells are co-transfected with the
                gRNA, Cas9, and donor template using transfection methods such
                as electroporation, lipofection, or viral vectors (e.g.,
                lentivirus or AAV). These methods vary depending on the cell
                type and efficiency requirements.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Antibiotic Selection/Fluorescence Screening</strong>: If
                the donor contains a selection marker, antibiotic resistance or
                fluorescence-based sorting (e.g., FACS) can be used to enrich
                cells that have undergone successful knock-in.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>PCR and Sequencing</strong>: PCR is used to amplify the
                regions flanking the insertion site, followed by sequencing to
                confirm that the gene of interest was correctly integrated into
                the safe harbor locus.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Validation of Transgene Expression and Function</strong>

            various disease models, antibody production, and iPSC regeneration.
