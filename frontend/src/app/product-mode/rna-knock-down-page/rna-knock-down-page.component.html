        <h1>Technical Background</h1>
        <p>
            CRISPR RNA Knockdown utilizing <strong>Cas13</strong> is an
            innovative approach to post-transcriptional gene regulation. Unlike
            the Cas9 protein used in traditional CRISPR gene editing for
            introducing double-strand breaks, Cas13 is an RNA-guided RNA
            endonuclease that specifically targets and cleaves RNA molecules.
            This ability makes it an effective tool for knocking down gene
            expression by degrading messenger RNA (mRNA) transcripts.

        <h2>Key Components:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Cas13 Protein</strong>: A member of the CRISPR family
                that targets RNA instead of DNA. Cas13 is derived from certain
                bacterial species, such as <em>Leptotrichia shahii</em> and
                <em>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</em>.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Guide RNA (gRNA)</strong>: A synthetic RNA molecule
                designed to bind to the target mRNA. It contains a sequence
                complementary to the target RNA, directing Cas13 to the specific
                mRNA for cleavage.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h1>Features of Our Products</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>
                As an alternative to RNAi, our approach significantly reduces
                off-target activity in cultured cells compared to traditional
                RNA interference.
            </li>
            <li>
                We offer two distinct kits:
                <strong>vector kits</strong> designed for use with cancer cell
                lines and <strong>virus kits</strong> tailored for
                hard-to-transfect cells.
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h1>Experimental Process</h1>
        <h3>Designing gRNA</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                gRNA is designed to specifically bind to the mRNA of the gene of
                interest. Tools are available to assist in selecting optimal
                gRNA sequences that minimize off-target effects.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Delivery of CRISPR Components</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Plasmid Transfection</strong>: Introducing plasmid DNA
                encoding Cas13 and gRNA into cells.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Viral Vectors</strong>: Using lentiviruses or AAVs to
                deliver the components into hard-to-transfect cells.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Validation</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Quantitative PCR (qPCR)</strong>: Measuring the levels
                of the target mRNA to confirm successful knockdown.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Western Blotting</strong>: Assessing the corresponding
                protein levels to validate the reduction in gene expression.
