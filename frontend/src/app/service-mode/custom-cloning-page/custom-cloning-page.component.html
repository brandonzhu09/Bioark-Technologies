        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Molecular Cloning Techniques:</strong> The service
                utilizes advanced molecular cloning methods such as restriction
                enzyme digestion, ligation, and Gibson assembly to construct
                vectors efficiently and accurately.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Promoter and Selection Marker Selection:</strong>
                Knowledge of various promoters and selection markers ensures
                that the constructed vectors provide robust expression in the
                intended host cells.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Viral Vector Engineering:</strong> For applications
                requiring stable gene expression, our service includes the
                design of viral vectors, such as lentiviruses and
                adeno-associated viruses (AAV), known for their ability to
                transduce a broad range of cell types.
