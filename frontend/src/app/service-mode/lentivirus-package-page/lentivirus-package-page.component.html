    <h2>Lentivirus Package Services</h2>
    <hr class="heading-line" />
    <p>
        Lentivirus packaging services provide researchers with the tools and
        components needed to produce lentiviral vectors for gene delivery into a
        variety of target cells, including dividing and non-dividing cells.
        Lentiviral vectors are derived from the Human Immunodeficiency Virus
        (HIV) and are widely used in gene therapy, functional genomics, and the
        development of stable cell lines.

        <h1>Technology Background</h1>
        <h3>Lentivirus Vectors Construction</h3>
        <p>
            The construction of lentiviral vectors commonly utilizes a
            <strong>three-plasmid system</strong>, which includes:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Transfer Plasmid:</strong> Contains the gene of interest
                and a promoter to drive expression.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Packaging Plasmid:</strong> Provides the necessary viral
                proteins (<strong>gag</strong>, <strong>pol</strong>, and
                <strong>rev</strong>) required for virus assembly.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Envelope Plasmid:</strong> Provides the envelope
                glycoprotein (e.g., <strong>VSV-G</strong>) that allows the
                virus to enter target cells.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Production Process</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Transfection:</strong> The three plasmids are
                co-transfected into suitable producer cells (e.g.,
                <strong>HEK293T cells</strong>) using a transfection reagent.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Virus Assembly and Release:</strong> The cells produce
                lentiviral particles, which are released into the culture
                medium.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Collection and Concentration:</strong> The lentiviral
                supernatant is harvested, filtered, and concentrated (if
                necessary) to yield a high-titer viral stock.
            </li>
        </ul>
