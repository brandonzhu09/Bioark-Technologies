        <h1>Technology Background</h1>
        <h3>Stable Cell Line Development</h3>
        <p>
            Stable cell lines are crucial for consistent and reproducible
            studies in gene function, drug discovery, and therapeutic research.
            The establishment of a stable cell line involves integrating a gene
            of interest into the host cell genome, allowing for continuous
            expression over many passages.
        </p>
        <h3>Vector Design</h3>
        <p>
            The choice of vector and the method of integration (random vs.
            targeted) play significant roles in the functionality and stability
            of the expressed protein. Our service focuses on minimizing random
            integration events, which can lead to silencing of the transgene or
            disruption of endogenous genes.
        </p>
        <h3>Transfection Methods</h3>
        <p>
            Different cell types necessitate various transfection techniques to
            achieve optimal expression. Currently, we offer two methods:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Standard Vectors:</strong> This approach offers lower
                integration rates and is ideal for delivering larger transgenes
                without disrupting host genes.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Lentiviral Transduction:</strong> This method allows for
                stable integration into the host genome, enabling the long-term
                expression of the gene of interest, even in non-dividing cells.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Selection and Validation</h3>
        <p>
            Employing selective markers ensures that only cells containing the
            desired genetic modifications are expanded. Subsequent validation
            techniques confirm successful integration and expression, providing
            assurance of experimental reliability.
        </p>

        <h1>Service Content</h1>
        <h3>Customizable Cell Line Development</h3>
        <p>
            We offer tailored services to develop stable cell lines according to
            specific project requirements, including different cell types and
            functional characteristics.
        </p>
        <h3>Vector Construction</h3>
        <p>
            Design and construction of plasmid vectors containing the desired
            gene or genetic modification, often including selectable markers for
            efficient screening.
        </p>
        <h3>Transfection Techniques</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Lipofection:</strong> For adherent cells.</li>
            <li>
                <strong>Electroporation:</strong> For hard-to-transfect cell
                types.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Viral Transduction:</strong> Using lentiviruses or AAVs
                to deliver genetic material into target cells.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Selection and Expansion</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Application of selective pressure (e.g., antibiotic selection)
                to isolate successfully transfected cells.
            </li>
            <li>Expansion of selected clones in controlled environments.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Validation of Stable Cell Lines</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Genomic Analysis:</strong> Verification of gene
                integration via PCR or sequencing.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Expression Analysis:</strong> Assessing the expression
                levels of the target gene using techniques such as qPCR, Western
                blotting, or flow cytometry.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Cryopreservation</h3>
        <p>
            Preservation of stable cell lines in liquid nitrogen for long-term
            storage and future use.
